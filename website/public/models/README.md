# GLTF Model Setup

## Instructions for adding the sus_room.gltf model:

1. Download the sus_room.zip file from the GitHub comment
2. Extract the contents
3. Place the GLTF file and any associated textures in this directory: `website/public/models/`
4. The file should be named `sus_room.gltf` or `sus_room.glb`

The DigitalTwin component will automatically load the model from `/models/sus_room.glb`

## Expected structure:
```
website/public/models/
├── sus_room.glb (or sus_room.gltf)
└── [any texture files if separate]
```
