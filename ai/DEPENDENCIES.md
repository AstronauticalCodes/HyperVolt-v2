# Dependencies

All Python dependencies for the HyperVolt system (including AI/ML components) have been consolidated into the root `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

From the root HyperVolt directory:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies for:
- Django API (Module 2)
- AI/ML components (Module 3)
- Testing frameworks
- Data visualization tools

## Note

The previous `ai/requirements.txt` file has been merged into the root requirements file for easier dependency management and to avoid version conflicts.
